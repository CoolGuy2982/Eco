It discusses the two strategies of recycling: open-loop recycling and closed- loop recycling. These strategies are compared and the difference is that, open-looprecycling provides an opportunity for new product development while closed-loop is con\ufb01ned to the original products. Different recycling processes such as primary recycling, secondary (mechanical) recycling, tertiary recycling and energy recoveryare discussed by focussing on the processes, merits and demerits. Recycling is contributing to the sustainable management of wastes and, because of advances in technologies and systems for segregating, collecting and reprocessing of recyclablewastes, it is rapidly expanding. It is creating new opportunities for integration with industries, communities and the governments. Keywords Recycling \u00b7Plastics"

Coelho ( 2011 ) af\ufb01rms that, recycling reintroduces unwanted materials and/or energy back into the production system. The unwantedmaterials reintroduced into the production system can be plastics, metals, papers etc. The materials used in the recycling activities are substitutes for virgin materials that would have been obtained from scarce natural resources such as petroleum, trees, coaland many others. From the sustainability angle, there are many bene\ufb01ts associated to recycling other than virgin material substitution. Al-Salem et al.

A number of processes including chemical recycling has emerged as a result of the drawbacks experienced in mechanical recycling (Kumar et al. 2011 ; Angyal et al. 2007 ). These recycling processes are discussed in more detail later. From the circular economy perspective, categorization of recycled materials is based on the product manufactured from the secondary raw materials (Ragaert et al.Introduction to Recycling 3 2017 ). The two terms that focus on material to product processes are \u201cclosed-loop\u201d and \u201copen-loop\u201d recycling. These two terms are most important for making an objec- tive division on the new product manufactured.

Coupled with these guidelines and decrees, many methods of recycling PSWs that depend on sources of plastics, polymer type and package design have been developed. The difference in the recycling processes presents some challenges and hence some studies have been conducted to explain the sequential steps involved (Hopewell et al. 2009 ).

This is the best recycling method for plastics because of its merits on less energy consumption and fewer resources while more retain onfossil fuels. This recycling method is referred to as the closed-loop recycling strategy because of its ability to reuse products in their original structure (Grigore 2017 ). Primary recycling presents advantages such as; simplicity and low cost. Nevertheless,scraps of PSWs must be from a single waste source and pure (Bartolome et al. 2012 ).

However, mechanical recycling has a demerit of deteriorating the properties of recyclable materials and hence degrading the polymers. Occurrence of low molecular weight compounds and heterogeneity of plastic wastes is anotherdisadvantage. Grigore ( 2017 ) asserts that, secondary recycling represents a physical method- ology in which recovered PSWs are transformed through cleaning and drying, sizing,agglomeration, extrusion and manufacturing. Transformed PSWs can be combined with virgin materials for excellent results. However, it is challenging to recycle PSWs or wastes that are complex and contaminated.

The presence of depolymerizing agents, monomers and resin synthesis are some of the advantages presented in chemical recycling. The process of recycling PET is grouped into methanolysis, glycolysis and hydrolysis. PET producers recycle using Methanolysis and PET is reduced using methanol at higher pressure and temperature. The pressure is between 2 and 4 MPa and tempera- ture between 180 and 280\u00b0 (Paszum and Spychaj 1997 ). Its drawbacks include; high cost, high temperature and pressure (Shukla et al. 2009 ). Glycolysis begins by crushing the PSWs into \ufb02akes and these are cleaned to remove contaminants. The dried \ufb02akes are then extruded into desired products. Inother cases, virgin PET is blended with the \ufb02akes for quality improvement (Tshifu- laro and Patnaik 2020 ).

        "text": "Chemical recycling through monomerrecycling and pyrolysis are technologies that are showing a lot of potential in the recycling industry. Therefore, the recycling industry should invest in research that can provide feasible implementation plans for these technologies. Mechanical recy- cling as an established business in many developed economies is pro\ufb01table and can generate new polymer with minimum investment. It is a comparatively an advanta-geous route to polymer manufacturing and can be used to recycle many polymers. For example, mechanically recycling LDPE and HDPE has the potential to generate the largest pro\ufb01t by 2030 (Hydrocarbon processing 2019 ). As a result of the demerits found in mechanical recycling such as quality deterioration and residue build-ups, chemical recycling through pyrolysis provides an optimal value treatment option while monomer recycling provides the highest recycling pro\ufb01tability levels. Contextual development of recycling systems has the potential to"

For example, most emerging economies lack waste sortinginfrastructure and therefore, the wastes recovered is a small percent of the waste \ufb02ow. An assessment of wastes generated and collected should be the starting point. Once these waste management capabilities are established, waste segregation strate-gies should follow. When this is achieved, pyrolysis of mixed PSWs can be the most ef\ufb01cient option. By 2030, plastics reuse could increase to 50% of its production (Hydrocarbon processing 2019 ) assuming enforcement of regulatory frameworks and adjustments in the oil prices. The regulatory frameworks should be supported by industry stake- holders and consumers. To achieve a 50% reuse in plastics, capital investments is required. The demand for plastics will continue to grow worldwide and it is imperative to establish effective systems for managing PSWs. Development of"

These merits and demerits have enabled the recycling of different types of PSWs.As innovations and technological advancement continue to emerge, improvements within the recycling space continue to advance. This advancement in technology through research is needed by the recycling companies because the plastic manufac- turing industry is not waiting for recycling technology to advance before they design and manufacture new products. Integration of the required stakeholders, regulation enforcement, knowledge and awareness on recycling and systems development are needed for successful imple- mentation of recycling programs but should be contextually aligned. Societal inte-gration in the recycling process is necessary because waste is generated from all aspects of life i.e. workplaces and households. Lastly, the different strategies for recycling PSWs are not 100% sustainable but are contributing to resolving the PSWsproblems. References Al-Sabagh AM, Yehia FZ, Eshaq G, Rabie"
