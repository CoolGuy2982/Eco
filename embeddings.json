The iconic recy- cling symbol has 3 chasing arrows. Each arrow represents one step in the three -step process that completes the recycling loop. The first step is collection . Materials are taken from the curbside or drop -off center. The second step is processing and marketing of recycled materials. Materials are sorted and then sold. The third step is manufacturing . The recycla- bles are converted into new products and take on a new life as consumer goods. The fourth step is consumer purchase of prod- ucts made from recycled material. This chapter will cover step one, the collection process; step two, the processing and market- ing; and step three, manufacturing. It includes what materials are recyclable and how different recyclable materials are processed into new products and, finally, the benefits of recycling. 2. The Recycling Circle"

In 1991, Oregon passed legis- lation requiring that rigid plastic containers be recycled at a 25 percent rate. Because there was no place to take the materials for sorting, consol- idation, and transferring, the American Plastics Council (APC) helped Oregon establish a plastics recovery facility (PRF) by providing a high technology plastic container separation sys- tem.

Due to economics, Garten Services closed the PRF. Plastics are difficult to recycle because each of the different resin types is chemically bonded in a different way. It is helpful to think of the plas- tics as being made with different recipes so they are not compatible. To genuinely recycle a plas- tic resin, it must be melted, converted to the orig- inal petrochemical gas from which it was creat- ed, and formed back into a product. The plastics recycling with which most consumers are famil- iar does not follow this path because it is not cost effective. To prevent unlike resins from contaminating one another, the Society of the Plastics Industry, Inc.

In general, there are three types of systems used to collect recyclables: material recovery, co - mingling, and source separation. Material Recovery systems extract recyclables from mixed waste or high -grade loads using a variety of manual and mechanical methods. Me- chanical separation takes advantage of physical properties such as size, density, magnetism, buoyancy, and color. These types of systems do not require waste generators (such as the con- sumer or employee) to separate or sort recycla- bles. Source Separation means that recyclables are segregated from other wastes at the point of gen-Chapter IV Page 81 Master Recycler Program 2020 eration \u2014at home or work \u2014and are collected separately from garbage.

Are the recyclables in good condi- tion being processed this way? Most mixed re- cycling programs require isolation of materials that will contaminate others when collected to- gether. In Linn and Benton counties, the curbside programs collect glass bottles and jars and motor oil, separately from other recyclable materials. Yard debris is also collected in a separate con- tainer. Mixed recycling has made it easier for people to recycle at the curb and has reduced confusion about what to separate. This has led to increased recycling rates.

Some communities also collect food scraps and yard waste in another roll cart. Preparing Recyclables for Collection Recyclable materials must be prepared properly so that they are free of contaminants and may be handled easily by a hauler. Collection Methods There are four common ways of collecting source -separated recyclables: deposit system, curbside collection, depots, and buy -back cen- ters.

The use of corrugated paperboard can date back to the mid 1800s in the clothing fashion industry. In 1856, two Englishmen, Healey and Allen, re- ceived a patent for the first known use of corru- gated paper. Using a hand -cranked adaptation of a collar press (originally intended for pressing pleats and ruffles on clothing), they started pro- ducing \"pleated\" paper to line tall, stiff men's hats that were so popular in Victorian England. Corrugated paper was stronger than the cylinder of plain paper previously used to line hats and its flutes provided cushioning in the sweatband. The first use of corrugated paper for packaging came in 1871, when an American, Albert Jones, intro- duced an idea of wrapping bottles and glass chimneys in it. It was the addition of a liner to one and then to the other side of corrugated pa- per that signaled the"

Walls of cardboard boxes consist of two main parts: linerboard (or facing) and corrugating me- dium (fluted paper). The flutes in the corrugating medium form a series of connecting arches. An arch with a certain curve can support many times its own weight, especially when the ends of the arch are anchored. In corrugated containers, they Figure IV -5. Recycling rates for selected material. Chapter IV Page 86 Master Recycler Program 2020 are anchored to a facing. A vertical sheet of lin- erboard, used as the skin or facing, can support a weight greater than itself if it is held in place. Most linerboard is produced using softwoods. They have the longest fibers, and produce the strongest paperboard. The fluted corrugating ma- terial helps it stay in place, while the facing, in turn, protects the flutes from damage. Containers made from these materials protect products both from external forces and sudden temperature changes."

The tin is melted off of the electroplates and poured into ingots, or bar-shaped molds. It may be used for new cans, as an ion exchange in metal extraction processes, or in fluoride toothpaste.

It can be difficult for consumers to understand the differences between these terms. Many businesses also did not explain how their emissions reductions and offsets were calculated, the steps being taken to reduce their carbon footprint, or the types of offsetting projects being funded. 2. A lack of substantiating information Many businesses made environmental and sustainability claims without providing any evidence to back up their claims. While some of the concerning claims identified in the sweep may be accurate, this was difficult to verify without evidence. While some businesses did attempt to provide substantiating information, in many cases the evidence provided was not sufficient to validate the claims. Some businesses linked to information which consisted of further unqualified claims, didn\u2019t provide any additional detail, or was outdated. Some other businesses claimed to"

Use of absolute claims The sweep identified a range of businesses making absolute claims about their products or services. These included claims that products are: \u0083100% plastic free \u0083100% recyclable \u0083Made from 100% recycled content \u0083Non-polluting6 Greenwashing by businesses in Australia \u0083100% carbon positive \u0083Zero emissions. These types of absolute claims give a very strong impression to consumers. If the product does not live up to this impression, the claim may be misleading.

This included claims that a product is \u2018kerbside recyclable\u2019 in cases where the product was not accepted by most kerbside recycling streams. Claims that products are made from 100% recycled materials were also common and will need to be examined further to determine if they are accurate. 4. Use of comparisons Some businesses made claims which compared the benefits of their product to products sold by other businesses, or products made from other materials. Businesses also made comparisons between their own products to highlight improvements. However, there were many instances where these comparisons were not useful"

It was also unclear how or why the certification was relevant to individual products. There were also some concerns that businesses were using their certifications in a misleading or confusing way. For example, broad statements that a business is \u2018certified\u2019 may give the impression that the entire business is certified when this may not be the case.

It can be difficult for consumers to understand what every CTM means or to assess how robust the scheme is. Some businesses have also created their own certification schemes for their own products. This raises concerns that CTMs may be becoming meaningless, and no longer help consumers to distinguish between different products. 8 Greenwashing by businesses in Australia8.

The ACCC will be conducting further analysis of these issues and will undertake enforcement, compliance, and education activities where appropriate. This will include producing updated economy-wide guidance material, as well as targeted guidance for specific sectors. The ACCC will also engage directly with businesses and industry associations to improve compliance with the ACL. Where concerns have been identified with specific businesses, a more targeted assessment of the conduct will be undertaken to determine the appropriate compliance"
