Analyze the image in detail and provide a comprehensive description without mentioning people or humans. If there is a red box in the image, the user emphasizes what's in that red box. Follow these steps:

1. Main Purpose Identification: Determine the main purpose of the image by analyzing its contents and considering the user query: {spoken_text}. Use these observations to select the most fitting tool:
    
    - Nature (Tool A): Choose this if the image prominently features nature and natural environments such as forests, rivers, mountains, wildlife, or nature in general. Look for elements that emphasize ecological dynamics.
    - Recycling (Tool B): Choose this if the image features any item/product in a home or outdoor setting or generally looks like trash. This could be any type of item/product.
    - Greenwashing (Tool C): Opt for this if the image shows products in a commercial setting, like a store, being advertised with environmental claims. Look for labels like "eco-friendly," "sustainable," "green," "ethical," "organic," or "natural" on packaging, particularly in contexts that might suggest exaggerated or misleading claims.
    - Composting (Tool D): Use this if the image includes biodegradable materials suitable for composting. This might include food scraps, yard debris like leaves and grass, or other organic waste clearly intended to decompose in a compost setting.
    - Food (Tool E): Choose this tool if the image displays food storage or preparation areas such as kitchens, pantries, or refrigerators, featuring ingredients either being used for cooking or stored for future use, or food items.
    - Recipe (Tool F): Use this tool if the image features multiple ingredients that can be used to create a dish. This typically applies to kitchens, fridges, pantries, or other culinary settings.
    - Plant (Tool G): Select this if the image focuses on individual plants or garden settings.
    - Biodiversity (Tool H): Use this tool if the image showcases diverse ecosystems or multiple species.
    - Microscope (Tool I): Choose this tool for images with microscopic details.
    - Barcode (Tool J): Use this tool for images where barcodes are prominently displayed and may need analysis.
    - Eco Response (Tool K): Choose this if the image addresses a specific environmental issue or query.

Hints: Generally, the item in question, if there is one, will be in the center of the frame.

ANY PICTURE WITH AN ITEM (not food, recipe, compost, nature, microscopic, plant or those things) WILL ALWAYS GO TO TOOLS B, C, or J. NEVER ANYTHING ELSE. BE very deliberate with your tool choice. It needs to be perfect.
IF THE ITEM HAS A BARCODE PROMINENTLY IN THE IMAGE, IT WILL ALWAYS GO TO BARCODE (TOOL J)
IF IT IS AN ITEM IN QUESTION IN A HOME OR A SPECIFIC PRODUCT IN FOCUS OUTDOORS ENVIRONMENT, IT WILL ALWAYS GO TO RECYCLING (Tool B)
IF IT IS AN ITEM IN A STORE OR COMMERCIAL PLACE without barcode emphasis, IT WILL ALWAYS GO TO GREENWASHING (Tool C)
