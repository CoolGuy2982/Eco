            Analyze the image in detail and provide a comprehensive description without mentioning people or humans. If there is a red box in the image, the user emphasises on what's in that red box. Follow these steps:

            1. Main Purpose Identification: Determine the main purpose of the image by analyzing its contents and considering the user query: "{spoken_text}". Use these observations to select the most fitting tool:
            - Nature (Tool A): Choose this if the image prominently features nature and natural environments such as forests, rivers, mountains, or wildlife. Look for elements that emphasize ecological dynamics, like interactions among animals, plant growth, or seasonal changes in landscapes.
            - Recycling (Tool B): Choose this if the image features any item/product in a home or outdoor setting or generally looks like trash. This could be any type of item/product.
            - Greenwashing (Tool C): Opt for this if the image shows products in a commercial setting, like a store, being advertised with environmental claims. Look for labels like "eco-friendly," "sustainable," "green," "ethical," "organic," or "natural" on packaging, particularly in contexts that might suggest exaggerated or misleading claims.
            - Composting (Tool D): Use this if the image includes biodegradable materials suitable for composting. This might include food scraps, yard debris like leaves and grass, or other organic waste clearly intended to decompose in a compost setting.
            - Food (Tool E): Choose this tool if the image displays food storage or preparation areas such as kitchens, pantries, or refrigerators, featuring ingredients either being used for cooking or stored for future use.
            - General Specialist (Tool F): Use this tool if the image doesn't fit any of the other categories even vaguely. This is for ambiguous queries where physical items are generally tools B & C, not F. YOU WILL RARELY CHOOSE THIS TOOL.

            Hints: Generally, the item in question if there is one will be in the center of the frame.
            
            ANY PICTURE WITH AN ITEM WILL ALWAYS GO TO TOOLS B or C. NEVER ANYTHING ELSE. BE very deliberate with your tool choice. It needs to be perfect.
            IF IT IS AN ITEM IN QUESTION IN A HOME OR A SPECIFIC PRODUCT IN FOCUS OUTDOORS ENVIRONMENT, IT WILL ALWAYS GO TO RECYCLING (Tool B)
            IF IT IS AN ITEM IN A STORE OR COMMERCIAL PLACE, IT WILL ALWAYS GO TO GREENWASHING (Tool C) 

            2. Detailed Description: Based on the selected tool, provide a detailed description focusing on the following aspects:
            - Nature (Tool A):
                - Identification: Identify the primary object or scene, including specific species of plants and animals.
                - Condition: Note any visible features such as health, growth stage, or signs of disease.
                - Composition: Describe key characteristics of the species, including size, color, and distinctive features.
                - Contextual Clues: Consider surrounding elements that provide ecological context, such as other species or environmental conditions.
                - Special Characteristics: Highlight unique features relevant to biodiversity insights, like habitat details or ecological interactions.
            - Recycling (Tool B):
                - Identification: Identify the primary item, including specific types like type 3 plastic or aluminum Coca-Cola can.
                - Condition: Note any visible features such as contamination or damage.
                - Text Details: Note any text on the item related to the material of the packaging.
                - Composition: Describe materials or components of the item, including recyclability information.
                - Contextual Clues: Consider surrounding items that provide context, such as packaging or location.
                - Special Characteristics: Highlight any greenwashing aspects or other sustainability insights, including label information.
            - Greenwashing (Tool C):
                - Identification: Identify the primary item, including specific types like type 3 plastic or aluminum Coca-Cola can.
                - Condition: Note any visible features such as contamination or damage.
                - Composition: Describe materials or components of the item, including recyclability information.
                - Contextual Clues: Consider surrounding items that provide context, such as packaging or location.
                - Special Characteristics: Highlight any greenwashing aspects or other sustainability insights, including label information.
                - Text Details: Transcribe all visible text on the packaging/product.
            - Composting (Tool D):
                - Identification: Identify the primary compostable item, such as vegetable scraps or garden waste.
                - Condition: Note any visible features such as freshness or decomposition.
                - Composition: Describe the organic material and its compostability.
                - Contextual Clues: Consider surrounding elements that provide context, such as other compostable items or compost bins.
                - Special Characteristics: Highlight any signs of successful or unsuccessful composting.
            - Food (Tool E):
                - Identification: Identify the ingredients shown in a fridge, pantry, or the frame.
                - Condition: Note any visible features such as freshness or spoilage.
                - Quantity: List the general quantities of the ingredients.
                - Composition: List all the ingredients and their quantities if visible.
                - Contextual Clues: Consider surrounding items that provide culinary context, such as other ingredients or kitchen tools.
            - General Specialist (Tool F):
                - Identification: Identify the primary environmental query or issue.
                - Condition: Note any visible features relevant to the query.
                - Composition: Describe materials or components related to the query.
                - Contextual Clues: Consider surrounding elements that provide context.
                - Special Characteristics: Highlight any unique features relevant to the environmental query.
